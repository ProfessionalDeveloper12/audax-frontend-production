Let's say you want to multiply 12 x 13

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000 A:middle
For this one we will draw one line

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000 A:middle
For the two we will leave a little 
bit of space and will draw two lines

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000 A:middle
For the other numbers we will draw 
the lines to the other direction

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000 A:middle
Now we will group together different 
lines and will count the dots

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000 A:middle
Here we have six different dots

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000 A:middle
In the middle, we have 5 different dots

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000 A:middle
And on the other side we have one dot

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 A:middle
And that's the anser - 156
